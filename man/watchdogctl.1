.It Fl p, -pid Ar PID
PID to use for fail and reset command.
.It Fl v, -verbose
Enable verbose mode, otherwise commands are silent.

.Sh COMMANDS
Short forms of the below commands are allowed, as long as it is unique.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm clear
Clear reset reason, including reset counter.
.It Cm counter
Show reset counter, number of reboots since power-on.
.It Cm debug
Toggle daemon debug log level.  See also the
.Cm loglevel
command.
.It Cm disable | enable
Temporarily disable, or enable, daemon.
.It Cm loglevel Ar LEVEL
Adjust daemon log level: none, err, warn,
.Ar notice ,
info, debug.
.\" Change daemon log level, see also
.\" .Cm debug .
.It Cm reload
Reload daemon configuration file, like sending SIGHUP, but the command
does not return until
.Nm watchdogd
has completed.
.It Cm reboot Oo MSEC Oc Oo MSG Oc
Alias to
.Cm reset .
.It Cm reset Oo MSEC Oc Oo MSG Oc
Perform system reset, with an optional millisecond delay and an optional
message to be stored as the reset reason label (usually process name).
A zero
.Ar MSEC
argument is the same as omitting the argument, leading to an immediate
reset.  On systems with
.Xr finit 8 ,
.Nm watchdogd
will ask Finit to do an orderly shutdown (stop services, sync and
unmount all file systems) before performing the WDT reset.
.It Cm fail Oo MSEC Oc Oo MSG Oc
Like the
.Cm reset
command, records reset reason (see above
.Fl c CODE )
but does not reboot unless
.Ar MSEC
is given.  I.e., omitting the
.Ar MSEC
argument does not have the same effect as in the
.Cm reset
command.
.It Cm status
Show daemon status and reason of last reset, default command.  Please
note, output format has changed to JSON since v4.0.  It now shows all
configured devices and their status, including capability flags.
.It Cm version
Show program version.
